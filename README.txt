TO DO:
    Need to change all references to LED in all code to digital since this would apply to any digital signal.
    Add analog functionality.
    Add the ability to send sensor data to the client.


"index.html" is used to keep a raw copy of the website to be hosted on the ESP8266.

I make changes within "index.html" using VS Code for testing and readability. After making any changes to a section (header, footer, index, etc), copy and past into the "mypage.h" file that is included into the arduino code.
